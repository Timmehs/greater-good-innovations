title: New Page Example

# New Page

This is an example of a new page with an inserted image. It will automatically create a page at `/new-page-example` based on the initial title when you created the page. If the path created for a new page doesn't seem to be working got to the Forestry Sidebar > Settings > Preview and restart the server.

You can check what pages gatsby has compiled by triggering the 404 page (which will show up if your path isn't working).

To make your page navigatable from the menu, got to Forestry Sidebar > Nav Menu and create an entry of type `internal` (don't mispel it!)
