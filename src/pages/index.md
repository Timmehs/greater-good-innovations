  title: Personal Protective Equipment for Healthcare Heroes
  subtitle: Our most recent project is to help meet healthcare worker personal protective
    equipment PPE needs through Good Samaritan efforts. We are working directly with
    a rapidly growing community of makers who are using their own resources to 3D
    print face shields and masks for hospitals. Our role is to maintain the fundraising
    campaign that will cover the expenses of 3D printing and distribution of the PPEs.

    content: Svenskt Lorem ipsum är en ny version på den berömda Lorem ipsum stycket.
      Klassiska galenskaper man aldrig får använda är alltid roligt. Att man sedan
      kan flytta ett hus norrut är helt uppenbart felaktigt. Att man på senare år
      har använt tolv dagar; det är katastrof! Glada bläckfiskar hoppar aldrig ner
      för taket när de är på väg hemåt. I fjol hade jag fjorton, men nu har jag bara
      nio kvar.
