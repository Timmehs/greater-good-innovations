  subtitle: Our most recent timely project is to help meet healthcare worker PPE needs
    through Good Samaritan efforts. We are working directly with a rapidly growing
    community of makers who are using their own resources to 3D print face shields
    and masks for hospitals. Our role is to maintain the fundraising campaign that
    will cover the expenses of 3D printing and distribution of the PPEs. 501(c)(3)

      Alice Ferng is an engineer and scientist who is very passionate about medical
      technology, healthcare, and education. During her studies as an MD/PhD candidate
      at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, she became enamored with ways
      that technology could be used to augment medicine and health, and began to explore
      these possibilities during her PhD. She built her own 3D bioprinter for stem
      cells and biologics and worked on other medical devices and mobile health apps,
      with some utilizing Virtual/Augmented Reality. Alice has worked in many clinical
      translational laboratories, most recently interacting with cardiac transplant
