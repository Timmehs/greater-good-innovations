  title: Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Healthcare Heroes
  subtitle: Our most recent project is to help meet healthcare worker PPE needs through
    Good Samaritan efforts. We are working directly with a rapidly growing community
    of makers who are using their own resources to 3D print face shields and masks
    for hospitals. Our role is to maintain the fundraising campaign that will cover
    the expenses of 3D printing and distribution of the PPEs. 501(c)(3) status pending.

      Alice Ferng is an engineer and scientist who is very passionate about medical
      technology, healthcare, and education. During her studies as an MD/PhD candidate
      at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, she became enamored with ways
      that technology could be used to augment medicine and health, and began to explore
      these possibilities during her PhD. She built her own 3D bioprinter for stem
      cells and biologics and worked on other medical devices and mobile health apps,
      with some utilizing Virtual/Augmented Reality. These days, she is involved in
      Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning algorithm development for various
      healthcare applications, and in medical device/wearable technology development.</span>

      from Oakland, California. At Microsoft, they design Outlook and have facilitated
      as well as trained folks in facilitating dozens of design sprints with people
      of varying technical skills. Wendy arrived at UX design and research by way
      of customer service—their passion comes from a desire to solve problems rather
      than just apologizing for them. They strongly believe the key to being a successful
      designer is to have varied life experiences to inspire one''s ability to empathize
      on all levels. '

    content: Svenskt Lorem ipsum är en ny version på den berömda Lorem ipsum stycket.
      Klassiska galenskaper man aldrig får använda är alltid roligt. Att man sedan
      kan flytta ett hus norrut är helt uppenbart felaktigt. Att man på senare år
      har använt tolv dagar; det är katastrof! Glada bläckfiskar hoppar aldrig ner
      för taket när de är på väg hemåt. I fjol hade jag fjorton, men nu har jag bara
      nio kvar. Galna kossor lever glatt på åkern i norra Stockholm. Kanske kan man
      få ihop en lång text av detta eller behövs det helt enkelt fler meningar?
