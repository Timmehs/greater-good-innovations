  subtitle: Help us protect our Frontline Heroes from COVID-19. Personal protective
    equipment (PPE) supply shortages are already happening around local and national
    healthcare facilities, and we are far from being able to meet the demand with
    our current supply chains. We have not yet reached the peak of this unprecedented
    health crisis.   Your support will help us supply face shields to frontline workers,
    especially as we are approaching peak resource use - this is a race against the
    clock to protect our dedicated healthcare professionals in this coronavirus battle.   Our
    mission is to get face shields into the hands of those on the frontlines as quickly
    as possible!!! This will be achieved   This will be achieved through empowering
    and providing necessary resources to our growing community of makers 3D printing
    CDC and FEMA approved face shields. We currently have over 250 makers each with
    different access to resources. Your donation will be directly paying for cost
    of materials and transporting the finished face shields directly into the hands
    of healthcare professions throughout the state of Washington.
