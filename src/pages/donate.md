<h3>Help us protect Washington state frontline heroes from COVID-19</h3>
<p>
<Strong>
 Personal protective equipment (PPE) supply shortages are already happening around local and national healthcare facilities, and we are far from being able to meet the demand with our current supply chains. We have not yet reached the peak of this unprecedented health crisis.
</Strong>
</p>
<p>
Your support will help us supply face shields to frontline workers, especially as we are approaching peak resource use - this is a race against the clock to protect our dedicated healthcare professionals in this coronavirus battle. 
</p>
<p>
Our mission is to get face shields into the hands of those on the frontlines as quickly as possible!!! This will be achieved through empowering and providing necessary resources to our growing community of makers 3D printing CDC and FEMA approved face shields. We currently have over 250 makers each with different access to resources. Your donation will be directly paying for cost of materials and transporting the finished face shields directly into the hands of healthcare professions throughout the state of Washington.
